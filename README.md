# Requirements

* To build an interactive front-end site that responds to user actions. The user should engage actively by altering data and how the site displays. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub and contain HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
 

# Design 

* ## Fonts 

Google fonts were used to import the font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project. The font used in this project was Roboto.

* ## Icons 

I used the icons from Font Awsome Library. These icons seemed modern and easy to demonstrate the choices for the game.

* ## Colors

I used css colors from W3Schools and Coolors for the game.  

* Background-color for body: #f5f5dc;

* Background-color for the footer and header: #F6AE2D;

* Color for the headings: #ff0000;

* Color for points and icons: #000;

In addition Green and Red were used as a box-shadowing to indicate whether the user answered corretly or incorrectly. The grey color was used to indicate a draw.

# Features

# Testing

* I changed backgraound-color for header, footer and the refresh button from #ffff00 to #f6ae2d. That after I get feedback from my mentor. The idea is to do the color more a bit more pale so its easier on the eyes. 

* When I play the game for second time, I get a message on the console, see following image

* I have checked the game in several browsers and using several different devices of varying screen size.

* A challenege was to keep the integrity of the game as the while playing across smaller screens.

# Deployment

### After finishing the majority of the project I deployed the site on GitHub using the following steps:

## GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
